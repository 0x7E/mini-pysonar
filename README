This is a prototype implementation of PySonar, a "deep static
analyzer" for Python. It has a similar structure as the one I made at
Google, but has a very preliminary status. It has only the core parts
(variables, functions and calls), but lacks many important things such
as objects, modules etc.

You can find an introduction to the original Google version at:

A demo of it can be found here:

I interned at Google twice and made two versions of PySonar. The first
version of it was open-sourced by Google and you can download it from
Jython:

https://jython.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jython/trunk/jython/src/org/python/indexer

It has the same abstract interpreter structure as the second version,
but this version doesn't do inter-procedural analysis. It is more
efficient but some variables can't be resolved.

I currently have no motivation of developing PySonar further. The
purpose of putting this version of PySonar here is for pedagogical
purposes - to help people understand how to implement a static
analyzer by using abstract interpretation.
